#Python is weakly typed. Type as in data type.
#Example: s = "123" is a string but can do s * 4
#Can use single or double quote, doesn't matter as long as you are consistent
#variable is a pointer to a value
#left is name, right is value
#variabels have semantic value...should be clear and easy to understand/read
#Three types of variables: change constantly, constants, changes rarely
#constants generally in uppercase, something you don't want to change


grocery_list = ('apple', 'orange', 'banana')
for item in grocery_list:
	print item
	
# can use ''' multiline string as comment to define a function and Python help function
#Most people use single line comments
#expressions...mathematical expressions...reduce to a single value
#statements change your program
#some statements, like if, for, while, etc, need the colon
#operator takes input and gives you output, most are binary, do not have unary operators
# ** is exponent, + - * / == += -= *= /=
#index [] starts at 0, measure in offsets if name is matthew, how many offsets do you have to go to get m, 0
glist = 'milk eggs'
glist += ' bread'
#glist[0] = m
#to get last character [-1] starts at offset 0 = m and goes in the other direction
#index slicing[start:end:step] end goes up to but not including 
#if no start provided [:] start is 0, if no end provided [::] end is the end
#to reverse string [::-1], useful for a palindrome detector
#variable. and tab gives you list of functions you can run

#reading for this week: python tutorial on lists

Week 2:
-week 1 assignment
-conditionals
-writing our own functions
-debugging
-very simple blog backend

\ is a contiuation character to break to next line
.split() with no arguements uses whitespace
a set is a list of unique items
Trim can be done using translate
much easier to replace
Strings are immutable but when you use s.replace() it doesn't permanently change s
s = 'abc"
s.replace('a','x')
->'xbc'
s
->'abc'

s = list s and list will have same id/reference each other. changing 1 will change the other
s = list[:] sets s = to the elements/values in list

list is ordered, a set is not an ordered collection

join is a function attached to a string; can be used on a string and only on a string
	takes in a list or some sort of sequence of unique elements and joins them with the preceding string
	" ".join("this","is","a","sentence") = this is a sentence
	
strings are immutable but lists are...so to insert something into a string convert to list, insert, convert back to string

contiionals: like an if statement

Python doesn't use brackets/()/etc to evaluate conditionals, it uses whitespace (indentations)

for loop

if
elif
else

while, like if, will run if condition is true

lists
append adds a single item
extend adds all items individually
