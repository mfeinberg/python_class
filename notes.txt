#Python is weakly typed. Type as in data type.
#Example: s = "123" is a string but can do s * 4
#Can use single or double quote, doesn't matter as long as you are consistent
#variable is a pointer to a value
#left is name, right is value
#variabels have semantic value...should be clear and easy to understand/read
#Three types of variables: change constantly, constants, changes rarely
#constants generally in uppercase, something you don't want to change

# can use ''' multiline string as comment to define a function and Python help function
#Most people use single line comments
#expressions...mathematical expressions...reduce to a single value
#statements change your program
#some statements, like if, for, while, etc, need the colon
#operator takes input and gives you output, most are binary, do not have unary operators
# ** is exponent, + - * / == += -= *= /=
#index [] starts at 0, measure in offsets if name is matthew, how many offsets do you have to go to get m, 0

#glist[0] = m
#to get last character [-1] starts at offset 0 = m and goes in the other direction
#index slicing[start:end:step] end goes up to but not including 
#if no start provided [:] start is 0, if no end provided [::] end is the end
#to reverse string [::-1], useful for a palindrome detector
#variable. and tab gives you list of functions you can run
